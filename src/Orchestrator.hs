-- | This is more or less a dummy application to play around with
-- load balancing in NATS. The application is creating pairs of
-- items which, once they are created, will ping each other once per
-- second.
-- To create an item, publish the items id to: item.create.<id> and give
-- the item's peer id as payload.
